### Soft Actor Critic Implementation

- Pendulum-v1 and Mountain Car Continuous-v0 environments from gym by using Soft Actor Critic algorithm
- In Mountain Car Continuous solution, OU noise added to increase exploration.
- Pytorch is used to build machine learning models
- Models trained on CPU. 
- Trained on Apple Macbook M2 Pro (12 cpu cores 19 gpu cores, 16 gb ram)
- For more info [Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) Algorithm](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/sac.html)
- Python 3.9.19, numpy 1.26.4, gym 0.22.0, pytorch 2.3.1, pygame 2.2.0
- Coded to learn better
